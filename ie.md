Sure! Here are the answers for the first 10 two-mark questions:

1. What is Industrial Engineering?

Industrial Engineering is the branch of engineering that focuses on optimizing complex systems,
processes, and organizations by improving efficiency, productivity, and quality.


1. What are the types of productivity measures?

Labor productivity – Output per labor hour

Capital productivity – Output per unit of capital

Material productivity – Output per unit of material

Total productivity – Ratio of total output to total input



3. What are the different types of plant layouts?

Product layout – Based on product flow

Process layout – Grouped by similar processes

Fixed position layout – Product remains stationary

Combination layout – Mix of product and process layout



4. What are the factors affecting plant location?

Availability of raw materials

Transportation facilities

Labor availability

Market proximity

Government policies



5. Why is plant layout important for productivity?
A good plant layout reduces material handling, minimizes production time, improves workflow, and enhances overall productivity.


6. What are the steps involved in the plant layout procedure?

Planning requirements

Analyzing workflow

Designing layout options

Evaluating and selecting layout

Implementing and monitoring



7. What is the need for Work Study in Industrial Engineering?
Work study helps to improve efficiency by identifying unnecessary movements and optimizing the use of resources, reducing production costs and time.


8. What is the primary role of an Industrial Engineer?
To design, improve, and implement integrated systems of people, materials, information, and equipment to increase efficiency and productivity.


9. Define productivity.
Productivity is the ratio of output to input in a production process, indicating how efficiently resources are being used.


10. What is Ergonomics and why is it important in work systems?
Ergonomics is the study of designing work environments to fit the capabilities of workers, reducing strain and improving safety and performance.
