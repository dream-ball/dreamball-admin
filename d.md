# **2. Explain Coupling & Cohesion using a Suitable Scenario**  

### **Diagram Representation of Coupling and Cohesion**  

#### **High Coupling (Bad Design)**  
```  
+---------+   +---------+  
| Module A|-->| Module B|  
+---------+   +---------+  
```
- **Modules depend too much on each other**, making updates difficult.  

#### **Low Coupling (Good Design)**  
```  
+---------+        +---------+  
| Module A| ---->  | API     |  
+---------+        +---------+  
                        |  
                 +------------+  
                 | Module B   |  
                 +------------+  
```
- **Modules interact via an API**, making the system more flexible.  

#### **Cohesion Example**  
- **Low Cohesion (Bad):**  
  - A **"User Module"** handling **login, payments, notifications** (too many responsibilities).  
- **High Cohesion (Good):**  
  - Separate **"Authentication Module"** for login.  
  - Separate **"Payment Module"** for handling transactions.

**1. ATM System (Use Case Diagram, Activity Diagram, and Class Diagram)**

### **Introduction**
An Automated Teller Machine (ATM) allows bank customers to perform financial transactions like cash withdrawal, deposits, balance inquiries, and fund transfers without needing a bank employee. The ATM system involves multiple components such as users, the bank server, and the ATM machine itself.

---

### **Use Case Diagram for ATM Withdrawal**

#### **Actors:**
1. **Customer** ‚Äì Uses the ATM to withdraw money.
2. **Bank Server** ‚Äì Validates customer information and processes transactions.
3. **ATM System** ‚Äì Interfaces with the user and communicates with the bank server.

#### **Use Cases:**
- Insert Card
- Enter PIN
- Select Transaction Type
- Enter Amount
- Dispense Cash
- Print Receipt

#### **Diagram Explanation:**
- The **Customer** interacts with the ATM system to withdraw cash.
- The **ATM System** checks the authentication details with the **Bank Server**.
- If all validations pass, the ATM dispenses cash and prints a receipt.

---

### **Activity Diagram for ATM Withdrawal**

#### **Step-by-Step Process:**
1. The customer inserts their ATM card.
2. The system prompts for PIN entry.
3. The customer enters the PIN, which is validated.
4. The customer selects the ‚ÄúWithdraw Money‚Äù option.
5. The system prompts the user to enter the withdrawal amount.
6. The system checks if the user has sufficient balance.
7. If funds are available, the ATM dispenses cash and prints a receipt.
8. If not, a failure message is displayed.
9. The ATM ejects the card and ends the transaction.

---

### **Class Diagram for ATM System**

#### **Main Classes:**
1. **ATM** ‚Äì Controls ATM operations.
2. **Customer** ‚Äì Represents the ATM user.
3. **Card** ‚Äì Contains card details.
4. **Bank Server** ‚Äì Handles authentication and processing.
5. **Transaction** ‚Äì Stores details of financial transactions.

Each class has attributes and methods such as `validatePIN()`, `dispenseCash()`, and `checkBalance()` to define their responsibilities.

**2. Coupling & Cohesion (Using a Suitable Scenario)**

### **Introduction**
Coupling and cohesion are fundamental principles of software design that determine how system components interact and maintain their independence.

---

### **Coupling**
- Coupling refers to the degree of **dependence** between modules.
- **High Coupling** (undesirable) means modules rely heavily on each other, making changes difficult.
- **Low Coupling** (desirable) ensures modules are independent, improving flexibility and maintainability.

#### **Example:**
A payment gateway system tightly integrated with a single bank‚Äôs API has **high coupling**. If the bank API changes, the whole system must be modified. Using a generic payment interface reduces coupling.

---

### **Cohesion**
- Cohesion measures how well elements within a module work together.
- **High Cohesion** (desirable) means each module focuses on a single responsibility.
- **Low Cohesion** (undesirable) means a module handles unrelated tasks.

#### **Example:**
A User Management System that includes authentication, payments, and notifications has **low cohesion**. If authentication is handled separately, cohesion improves.

**5. System Design & Representation**

### **Introduction**
System design defines the architecture, components, and interactions of a system. It is specific to the problem being solved.

---

### **Types of System Design**
1. **High-Level Design (HLD)** ‚Äì Defines major components.
2. **Low-Level Design (LLD)** ‚Äì Specifies internal logic and interactions.

### **Example: E-commerce System Design**

#### **Architecture:**
- **Frontend (UI)** ‚Äì User interface for browsing.
- **Backend (Logic Layer)** ‚Äì Handles processing and transactions.
- **Database (Storage)** ‚Äì Stores user and product data.

By separating these components, the system becomes **scalable** and **maintainable**.

---

### **Conclusion**
Each of these five topics contributes to effective system development. ATM system diagrams clarify system interactions, coupling & cohesion improve modularity, SRS ensures proper software requirements, and system design principles create scalable applications. These principles apply to real-world software engineering for efficient system development.
